The Time Lords are a fictional, ancient extraterrestrial species in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, of which the series' protagonist, the Doctor, is a member.

Time Lords are so named for their command of time travel technology and their non-linear perception of time.

They developed a culture of custodianship and time-related technologies based on this perception which includes strictly controlled space/time travel machines (known as "TARDISes") and monitoring devices to travel through time and to prevent time from being subverted or abusedâ€”although actual action was described as rare in practice due to their traditional policy of strict non-interference and neutrality.
